# challenge1

## Description

The objective of 'Challenge 1' was to refactor an HTML file and a CSS Stylesheet which both contained what could be called "div soup", to be changed to semantic HTML, and many extraneous selectors and classes within the CSS stylesheet.

# FAQ

-How and Why do we change "div soup" to semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML contains many selectors which use a word, such as <header>, <footer>, <section>, and <aside>. The reason we want to use semantic HTML is so our code is easily readable, accessible, and understandable.

In order to switch our div soup to semantic HTML, we need to determine which <div> tags would equate to each semantic HTML tag, such as all information contained within a <main> tag which would normally be seperated by <div> tags be seperated by <section> tags instead.

-What CSS Selectors would be considered 'extraneous'?

While having one or two CSS selectors for one section isn't necessarily a bad thing, there is a point where you can have too many different selections for one area of HTML. For example, in our CSS file, I changed a lot of the list items in the <aside> section from their original 3 class selectors to one class selector, .list, since the code within each class was identical, they could be condensed down from three class selectors into one.
